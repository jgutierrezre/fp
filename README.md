### Students
- Juan Pablo Gutiérrez Restrepo
- Laura Rodríguez

### Files information
- The main file is parser.oz. This is the file that is responsible for interacting with the user and performing the operations that the user requests.
- The fp.oz file is the file that brings together everything related to the curry, the evaluator and the postfix/prefix
- The curry.oz file is in charge of making the curry, that is, creating the tree to later make the reduction
- The reduce.oz file is in charge of making the reduction to be able to make the evaluation of the given operation
- The infix2prefix_v2.oz file is an auxiliary file that is used previously to do the currying and create the tree

### Instructions to run it
- **Option 1:** run the fp.oz file first and then run the parser.oz file, if you want to add or change functions interact with the parser.oz file. Below are examples of its use.
- **Option 2:** first run the files: curry.oz, infix2prefix_v2.oz and reduce.oz and then run the parser.oz file, if you want to add functions or change them interact with the parser.oz file. Below are examples of its use.
